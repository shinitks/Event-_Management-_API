# **Event Management API**
A lightweight RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js for managing college events. It supports:

● Event creation

● Participant registration

● Capacity tracking

● Event updating and deletion

● JSON file-based data storage (no database needed)

## **📁 File-Based Storage**
Data is stored in local JSON files:

./data/events.json – stores event details

./data/registrations.json – stores participant registrations

./data/count.json – tracks number of registered participants per event
